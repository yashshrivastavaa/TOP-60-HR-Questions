**<summary>Tell me About Yourself!</summary>**
<br>
As a freshly graduate, I came across your job description. To my understanding, the position calls for a level-headed individual who is ready for new challenges. I believe that I am a perfect fit for this position. Being a student from Mechanical Engineering, I learned programming on my own. I have built projects that you can find on my Git-Hub, and I am always learning new things. In my engineering course, I have been an active student body member, and have worked as a mediator between students and faculty members. My biggest strength is perhaps that I never back down from a challenge, and always face a problem head on. If given the opportunity. I would prove to be an asset in your organization.
